# `@sables/router`

> A Redux-based routing library with distributed routing logic.

Building upon [Redux First History](https://github.com/salvoravida/redux-first-history),
Sables Router adds support for routes and asynchronous route transitions.

The library is designed to be integrated into any Redux project.
As a result, it can be used without the rest of the Sables framework.

Please view [the Sables Router documentation](https://sables.dev/docs/api#router) for more information.

## Install

```sh
npm install @sables/router
```
